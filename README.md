## But Why FirePad ❓

#### FirePad believes in faster and meaning full content generation, the only bottel neck most of the industry leading word/text editors is being away from keyboard aka (AFK) for formating text. Though keyboard shortcut are available ,not all formatting options are available through them .FirePad bridges this gap by providing full keyboard support to each and every formatting style that FirePad offers with additional meaningful text generation 😀

## Dependencies 🗃

### Short Answer
- [Electron] - **Core module**
- [Pell] - **Simpalistic WYSIWYG Editor**
- [Bootstrap] - **Frontend CSS Framework**
- [MouseTrap] - **Highlevel way of interacting with keyboard**

### Long Answer

- Firepad is made possible with [Electron] which allows web technologies to run on cross platform desktop environment by adding chromium on app instances, great now on the next one.

- Now we need a way for user to enter text in our app, simple right just put a html textbox and done NO!, using text box has its own limitation and dosent really go on with the notion of notepad like experince, this were [Pell] drops into picture, providing more than a textbox.

- This all plugs into [Bootstrap] UI , no need to explain bootstrap right?

- Now another core functionality of FirePad is providing keyboard shorcuts, this is achieved by high level api called [MouseTrap]

- Along with these core functionality modules FirePad also uses sub electron packages for some other built in functions
see `src/FirePadv1.0.0/package.json` for more details

## WIP 🛠
- More Shorcuts and functionality
- Writing scalable and clean code for rapid new modules integration
- Make it hackable , introducing of plugins for FirePad
- Implementing system-wide fonts



## Why should you contribute ❓
- There is a lot more stuff a industry leading text editing based apps can do which FirePad can't , in that note FirePad will grow and at some day people will be sharing .pad files instead of .txt 😅

- After giving 50+ hrs to this project , i realized project  like these should not have a one person prespective

- Projects like this need make you think about end users and one mind thinking about that is not a huge prespective

- Help grow FirePad , and help people move out of notepad 😁
